/* 
OBJECTS EXERCISE

1. Create three variables, called monkey1, monkey2, and monkey3, and set the 
   value of each to an empty object.

2. For each monkey object, add the following properties:
   * name (a string containing a name for the monkey, like Hermione)
   * species (a string containing a species of monkey, like howler)
   * foodsEaten (an empty array)

3. For each monkey object add the following methods:
   * eatSomething (takes a single parameter, and adds the value of that
     parameter to the foodsEaten array
   * introduce (logs a string introducing itself to the console, including its
     name, species, and what it's eaten)

4. Write JavaScript statements to do the following:
   * have each monkey eat at least two foods
   * log each property of each monkey to the console, using dot notation
   * have each monkey introduce itself
5. Open monkey.html in the browser, check the console, and verify that all
   statements produce the output you expect. 

BONUS 1: Rewrite the statements from Step 4 using square bracket notation.

BONUS 2: Rewrite your code to create a single constructor function, and build
each monkey object using the constructor. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects#Using_a_constructor_function
