/*
 * Question 0
 * Create a variable that stores the string "GA JSD Class 2 lab".

// This question is already completed for you as an example:
let q0 = 'GA JSD Class 2 lab';

 * Question 1
 * Create a variable called q1. As its value, create an array of image source
 * filenames. Use "image1.png", "image2.png", and "image3.png" as the array 
 * values.

/**
 * Question 5
 * Create a variable called numbers2 containing an array of numbers using 5, 17, 37, and 63 as values.
 * Create a variable called numbers2total. Set its value to the total of the values in the numbers2 array.
 * Hint: Think about how you can take advantage of a loop to accomplish this.
 * Create a variable called q5. Set its value to the average of the values in the numbers2 array.
 * (average = sum of all numbers/number of numbers).

/**
 * Question 6
 * Create an variable called q6.
 * Use a forEach function to increase each value in the numbers2 array by 1, then store the result as an array element in the q6 variable. This should result in the q6 variable
