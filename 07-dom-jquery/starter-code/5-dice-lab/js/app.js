/*

Creating a page where every time the user hits the "Roll Dice" button, the screen randomly updates the two dice. 
Review the HTML and CSS code included in the starter code. You will need to write only JavaScript/jQuery code to complete this exercise.

Your code should do the following
* generate a random number between 1 - 6 and store to a variable, random1
* generate a random number between 1 - 6 and store to a variable, random2
* combine 'dice-' and random1 to form the CSS class name to use for the first die, firstDie
* combine 'dice-' and random2 to form the CSS class name to use for the second die, secondDie
* get the first die by ID and update the CSS class name to firstDie 
  (Hint: Use jQuery to reference the element, and use the className property to set the name of the CSS class.)
* get the first die by ID and update the CSS class name to secondDie 
  (Hint: Use jQuery to reference the element, and use the className property to set the name of the CSS class.)
