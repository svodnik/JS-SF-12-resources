/*
Write code that creates a for loop that calculates 2 to the 10th power step by
step, and console.logs each step of the calculation. The for loop should 
console.log the result of 2^1, then the result of 2^2, etc., until it gets to 2^10.

Start by creating a variable to store the exponent, which is 10.

Then create a for loop to calculate each step of this process and log it to the console.

BONUS 1: Rewrite your code to allow a user to enter the exponent value, rather than hard-coding it into your program. (Hint: Read up on the window.prompt method at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt.)

BONUS 2: Rewrite your code to use a while loop rather than a for loop. (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while)

BONUS 3: Rewrite your code to use a do/while loop rather than a for loop or while loop. (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/do...while)
